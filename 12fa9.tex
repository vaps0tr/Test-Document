I want to add a table.
\begin{table} 
    \begin{tabular}{ c c c }
        asdf &amp; asdf &amp; asdf \\ 
        fda &amp; fds &amp; fdsa \\ 
    \end{tabular} 
    \caption{This is a table caption} 
    \label{tab:test_table_1}
\end{table}

Can you see me typing? It doesn't update in real time like Google does, but it did show you....

This is how you add an accent. Hol√°

Can I make a reference to a table? This is a ref to Table \ref{tab:test_table_1}.
