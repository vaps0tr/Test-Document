Hey, welcome. Hi Katie. 


hi

hello TIM! 

Weird Not sure how we can both edit


Double click anywhere on the text to start writing. In addition to simple text you can also add text formatted in \textbf{boldface}, \textit{italic}, and yes, math too: $E  =  mc^{2}$! Add images by drag'n'drop or click on the "Insert Figure" button. 

This is a test paragragh. I want to add a figure: Figure \ref{253882}.

How did you add that reference to figure 1? I can't figure out how to add a \verb{\label{}} to the figure, as I did to the table, and those numbers are totally unwieldy... -ELG

I suggest that for labeling in general we use the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item For tables, use "tab:table_name"
\end{itemize}

Testing citations which is very important. \cite{Eisenhardt1989} So you have to use the Mendeley command "Copy As..." and then BibTex record. Then this will work. -ELG
